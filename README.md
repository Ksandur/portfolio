# portfolio

This is my schoolproject "portfolio" - it is out here to learn from. Download it, edit it, break it and fix it again, it's all yours :)
(Share this with those friends who are failing class :))

If you are still working with any version pre-V4.2, please consider getting this new one!
I drastically reduced the size from 109MBs to only 32MBs!
(removed loads of useless images and compressed the video files)

Changing the background video can be done in >> /vid/animatiebg.mp4 <<.
Just replace the video with one that has an identical name.
